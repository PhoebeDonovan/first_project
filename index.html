      <h3>We've all walked the walk, time to talk the talk!</h3>
        <p>For decades many of us have enjoyed the luxuries of fine fabrics, exotic textures, vibrant colours and dynamic designs and perhaps felt the pinch at the checkout. But what is the true cost of our expensive taste? <br>
        <br> In this blog we will touch on a few of the major ethical issues consumers are faced with when it comes to our fashion choices.  <br>
        <br> Sadly, injustices can be found at the heart of every aspect of the fashion industry! If the brutality and loss of animal life isn't enough to put you off those leather boots or rabbit showl then how about the slave labour involved at every level of production and manufacturing? Still not enough? Don't consider yourself an animal? Or can't relate to third world problems? Well then how about the physical, sexual and mental abuse lurking under the skin of those who find themselves in the modelling industry? Why do you think the models all look like <em>death</em> herself walking the catrun?!
